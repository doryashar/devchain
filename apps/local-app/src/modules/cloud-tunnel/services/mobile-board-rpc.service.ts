 * reads go to storage ONLY after project validation.
 *
 * Every method is PROJECT-SCOPED: it loads the epic and asserts
 * `epic.projectId === projectId` first (the bridge proves instance ownership,
 * not per-project — the local-app holds many projects). A cross-project epic is
 * reported as a clean not-found so existence is never leaked.
 *
 * Errors propagate as-is to `toJsonRpcError`, preserving the domain code under
 * `error.data.code`:
 *  - assignee ∈ project is enforced by the storage `updateEpic` path
 *    (`ensureValidAgent`) → `ValidationError` (`validation_error`); NOT duplicated here.
 *  - version conflicts → `OptimisticLockError` (`optimistic_lock_error`); NOT remapped.
