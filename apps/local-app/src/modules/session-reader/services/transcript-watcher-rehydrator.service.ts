/**
 * Re-attaches transcript watchers for sessions that were already RUNNING before
 * the local-app (re)started.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 *   {@link TranscriptWatcherService} only ever starts a watcher in response to the
 *   `session.transcript.discovered` event, which is emitted from `session.started`
 *   — i.e. only when a session is *launched*. On a local-app restart, sessions that
 *   were already running do NOT re-emit `session.started`, so their watchers never
 *   re-attach. The freshness poll never runs, `session.transcript.updated` never
 *   fires, and live transcript updates (mobile + web) silently die for those
 *   sessions until they are reopened (the on-demand catch-up read still works,
 *   which is why "reopen to see new messages" appeared to work).
 *
 *   The terminal session registry is already rehydrated on boot the same way
 *   ({@link TerminalRegistryRehydrator}); transcript watchers were the missing half.
 *
 * SAFETY: {@link TranscriptWatcherService.startWatching} is idempotent (it skips a
 * session that already has an active watcher) and resolves the source kind itself,
 * so this is safe to run for every provider (file + DB) and safe alongside the
 * normal discovery path.
