/**
 * Unified assistant-turn coalescer — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for collapsing consecutive
 * same-context assistant messages into one conversational turn, applied centrally at the
 * cache choke-point (`SessionCacheService.getOrParse`) so EVERY provider gets identical
 * behavior. A tool-using exchange = 2 messages (1 user + 1 assistant) on every provider, no
 * matter how many tool steps/rounds happened inside; RENDERING is unchanged (all steps still
 * display — only the COUNT collapses).
 *
 * CONTINUATION CONTRACT (fail-safe): a consecutive assistant merges onto the preceding
 * assistant ONLY when the preceding turn carries an EXPLICIT continuation signal —
 * `stopReason === 'tool_use'`. `undefined` / `'end_turn'` / any unknown value is a turn
 * BOUNDARY. This is deliberately fail-safe: a future provider that does not declare a
 * continuation signal can never over-merge; it must opt in by setting `stopReason === 'tool_use'`
 * on its continuation steps. Additional boundaries: a real (non-merged) USER message, an
 * `isCompactSummary` entry, and an `isSidechain` mismatch.
 *
 * Codex caveat: the Codex parser NEVER sets `stopReason`, so the full-array pass relies on
 * BOTH (a) the `undefined → boundary` fail-safe AND (b) the Codex parser already coalescing a
 * turn into one message (so it never emits consecutive assistants). This asymmetry vs Claude —
 * which DOES set `stopReason` (`'end_turn'` vs `'tool_use'`) — is intentional: the pass is a
 * safety net for providers (e.g. OpenCode) that emit one message per tool STEP without
 * parser-level coalescing.
 *
 * The function is PURE: it never mutates the input session or any input message object (turns
 * that are merged are folded into a fresh clone). Idempotency — `coalesce(coalesce(x))` deep-
 * equals `coalesce(x)` — is the safety contract for the whole feature: a once-coalesced turn
 * carries the LAST step's `stopReason`, so a second pass finds nothing further to merge.
