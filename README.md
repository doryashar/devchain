Devchain runs your AI coding agents as coordinated teams — each with their own terminal session, task queue, and chat. Group agents under team leads, assign epics, track progress on a visual board, and let teams scale themselves to match the workload. Supports Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode out of the box.

## Features

### Agent Teams
Group agents into named teams with team leads that do real management. The **Builders** team grows itself with the workload and picks the right model for each task — cheaper models for routine changes, top-tier models for harder work. The **Planning** team supports parallel planning: add multiple Architects on different models and the Brainstormer gathers independent framings from each before drafting the master plan. Choose your allowed providers per team when you create the project.

### Mobile App
Drive and monitor your agent teams from your phone, in open beta on [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/VSbfE1c6) and [Android](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.twitech.devchain.mobile). Chat with agents, answer their AskUserQuestion prompts, reassign epics and add comments on the board, watch a live terminal viewport, and get push notifications the moment a session stops or needs your input. Everything between your PC and phone is end-to-end encrypted: the cloud relay only forwards sealed data it can't read, so your transcripts and commands stay private. Smart notifications, quiet hours, and per-project forwarding keep the noise down.

### Session Reader
Full transcript viewer for active agent sessions, built into the Chat page. See every tool call, thinking block, and response with real-time token usage, cost tracking, and compaction events. Supports Claude Code and Codex transcripts with AI turn grouping, collapsible cards, IQR-based token hotspot detection, and keyboard navigation.

### Context Tracking
Visual progress bars show each agent's context window usage in real time. Hover for exact token counts (e.g. "49% used — 98k of 200k"). An inline session summary bar in each terminal shows the active model, running cost, context percentage, and compaction count at a glance.

### Provider Model Override
Change any agent's provider and model on the fly from the context menu — no template editing required. Model overrides are per-agent and persist across restarts, layering on top of template defaults.

### Worktrees
Spin up isolated agent environments on dedicated git branches. Each worktree gets its own agent team, terminals, and chat — run multiple features in parallel and merge when ready. Worktrees run as Docker containers or local processes with full branch isolation.

### Container Isolation
Worktree containers are provisioned automatically from the official Devchain image on [GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/TwiTech-LAB/packages/container/package/devchain). Each container has Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI pre-installed, runs as a non-root user, and shares your git identity for correct commit attribution.

### Skills
Browse and sync AI agent skills from community sources (Anthropic, OpenAI, Vercel, and more). Enable or disable skills per project and expose them to agents via MCP tools.

### Visual Workflow Board
Kanban-style epic management with drag-and-drop, list view, board context menu, and URL-based filtering. Agents pick up tasks from the board and update status in real time. Auto-assign rules route epics to an agent or team lead automatically as they're created or move between statuses.

### Terminal Sessions
Real terminal streaming via tmux and WebSocket. Each agent gets its own session with scrollback, resize support, and inline access from the chat panel.

### Code Review
Live pre-commit diff viewer with agent integration, inline comments, `@mentions`, comment threading, and VS Code-style file navigation.

### Multi-Provider
Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, GLM models, and OpenCode. Switch providers per agent or switch the whole team preset with a single click.

### MCP Integration
Full Model Context Protocol support. Agents get access to epics, chat, skills, reviews, and more through MCP tools — auto-configured before each session.

### Local-First
All data is stored in a local SQLite database and the platform runs entirely on your machine. No cloud account is required to use it. If you opt into the mobile app, your PC and phone connect through an end-to-end encrypted relay, so even then your plaintext data never leaves your devices.

  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install tmux`
- **Docker** — optional, required for container-isolated worktrees
- **AI Provider** — at least one of:
  - [`claude`](https://claude.ai/claude-code) CLI

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g devchain-cli
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Devchain — opens browser automatically
devchain start

# Start with a specific project
devchain start --project /path/to/your/project

# Run in foreground with logs
devchain start --foreground

# Bind to all interfaces for VM/remote browser access
devchain start --host 0.0.0.0

# Stop the server
devchain stop
```

On first run, import a template from the project page to provision your agent team. Two templates are included:

| Template | Agents | Best for |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `teams-dev` **(recommended)** | Planning team (Brainstormer + Architect), Builders team (Epic Manager + Coders), Code Reviewer | New projects — auto-scaling Builders, parallel planning, tier-aware routing |
| `3-agents-dev` | Brainstormer, SubBSM, Coder | Faster iteration with lower token overhead |

---

## CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p, --port <number>` | Port to run on (default: 3000 or next available) |
| `--host <address>` | Bind address (default: `127.0.0.1`; use `0.0.0.0` for remote/VM access — see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)) |
| `-f, --foreground` | Run in foreground with visible logs |
| `--no-open` | Don't open browser automatically |
| `--db <path>` | Custom database directory path |
| `--project <path>` | Open with a specific project path |
